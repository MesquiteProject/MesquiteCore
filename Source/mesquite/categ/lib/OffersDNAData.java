Tests whether module will be compatible withpassed object.  Classes of modules will have known ways of responding to particular classes of objects, e.g. character sourcesshould test whether they can handle given CharacterState types.*This version says "I offer to give DNA data".  This is different from RequiresDNAData, which is used for consumers to say that is what they need*/public class OffersDNAData extends CompatibilityTest {	public boolean isCompatible(Object obj, MesquiteProject project, EmployerEmployee prospectiveEmployer){		if (obj == null)			return true;		if (obj instanceof OffersDNAData)			return true;		if (obj instanceof CompatibilityTest)			return false;		if (!(obj instanceof Class))			return true;		if (!CharacterState.class.isAssignableFrom((Class)obj) && !CharacterData.class.isAssignableFrom((Class)obj))			return true;		return  ((Class)obj).isAssignableFrom(DNAState.class) || ((Class)obj).isAssignableFrom(DNAData.class);	//to pass the test, the datatype requested must be DNA, Categorical, or generic	}	public Class getAcceptedClass(){		return DNAState.class;	}}
