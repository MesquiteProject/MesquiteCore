<p>NINJA is a Mesquite package to conduct a neighbor-joining analysis using Wheeler's NINJA software.</p>
<p>To construct a neighbor-joining tree in Mesquite with NINJA installed, open up a file containing a character matrix, and have that matrix frontmost.  Choose "Neighbor Joining (NINJA)" from the
Tree Inference submenu from the Taxa & Trees menu.  You will be asked to choose the sort of distance calculations to do, and then, if you have anything other than one matrix of the correct kind for that
type of distance (e.g., DNA matrix for F84 distance), you will need to choose the matrix.</p>
