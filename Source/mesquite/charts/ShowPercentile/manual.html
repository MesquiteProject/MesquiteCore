For example, the nearest two   percentiles in this distribution to 0.001 would be either 0.0 (including 0 values)   or 0.01 (including 1 value); Show Percentile chooses 0.0, as that is the nearest   value that does not exceed the requested percentile:</P><P><img src="001.gif" width="468" height="250"></P><P>The 0.05 lower percentile for this distribution is shown below:</P><P><img src="05.gif" width="468" height="250"></P><P>This might also be the distribution shown if you requested 0.06, as the nearest   percentiles for that value are 0.05 or 0.07, and so Show Percentile would choose   0.05. <br></P><P>Full details of the percentiles displayed can be seen by touching the Text   tab of the histogram window.</P><P>&copy; David Maddison &amp; Wayne Maddison, 2005</P></BODY></HTML>
