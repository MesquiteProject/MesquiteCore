At the same time,   another batch file might be created that could be used to ask another program   to read in, sequentially, each tree file, and conduct a synthetic analysis on   them. </P><H3><A NAME=installation></A>Installation</H3><P>To install the basic Batch Architect package, the "batchArch" directory must   be installed in the "mesquite" directory within "Mesquite Folder". It should   be present in a basic Mesquite installation.</P><H3><A NAME=features id="features"></A>Features</H3><h4><a name="embf"></a>Export Matrices &amp; Batch Files</h4><p>This feature, in the Batch Architect submenu in the Analysis menu, will export   multiple matrices and one or more associated batch files. </p><p>In choosing this feature, you will first be led through as serious of dialog   boxes in which you will choose how the matrices are to be created. Following   your choosing, the Export Matrices &amp; Batch Files dialog box will be presented:</p><p align="center"><img src="emb1.gif" width="336" height="356"></p><p>In this dialog box you are to specify the base name to be used both for the   matrices and in the batch file template system. For example, in the example   shown, 10 matrices will be created, with names &quot;SimMatrix1&quot;, &quot;SimMatrix2&quot;,   &quot;SimMatrix3&quot;, and so on. </p><p>The file names may have extensions added (e.g., &quot;.nex&quot;), depending   upon the matrix format to be used (the matrix format is specified in the batch   file template). The extension will be added automatically by Mesquite.</p><p>In this dialog you will most importantly also select the batch template to   use. A batch template specifies exactly how the batch file or files produced   will be structured. To examine or edit the template, use the Edit Templates   button. </p><p>Some batch templates contain code that requires &quot;<a href="#codesnippets">code   snippets</a>&quot; to be defined. If code snippets are needed by a template,   they will be listed in the dialog box. If some are needed but unavailable, the   list will appear in red and note them as unavailable:</p><p align="center"><img src="snippetNeeded.gif" width="320" height="48"> </p><p>You can define or edit snippets uing the Edit Snippets button.</p><p>Some batch templates require a tree to be chosen by the user; if so, and you   have not yet chosen a tree, &quot;TREE NEEDED&quot; will appear in red in the   box beside the Choose Tree button:</p><p align="center"><img src="treeNeeded.gif" width="248" height="24"></p><p>You can then use the Choose Tree button to choose your tree.</p><h4><a name="ebf"></a>Export Batch Files</h4><p>This is similar to the Export Matrices &amp; Batch Files feature expect that   no matrices are exported. This can be used to generate batch files for already   existing matrices, for example, or to automate processes other than the analyses   of matrices.</p><h4><a name="batchtemplates"></a>Batch Templates</h4><P>Batch templates contain the instructions telling Mesquite how to construct   the batch files. They are managed in the Batch Template Manager window, which   allow ones to create, duplicate, edit, rename, or delete templates:</P><P align="center"><img src="templateManager.gif" width="275" height="237"></P><P>You can also load templates from template files; this allows you to move templates   between copies of Mesquite. For example, if you create a template on one computer,   it will be stored as a single text file in the BatchTemplates in the Mesquite_Prefs   directory in the Mesquite_Support_Files directory on your disk. You can then   move that file to another computer, and load it into Mesquite on that computer   using the Load button. </P><P>Selecting a template in the Batch File Template Manager and pressing &quot;View&quot;   (if it is a pre-defined template) or &quot;Edit...&quot; (if it is a user-defined   template) will bring forth the Batch Template Editor, in which the template   can be viewed or edited:</P><P align="center"><img src="batchtemplate.gif" width="348" height="408"></P><P>See the page on <a href="batchtemplates.html">Designing Batch Templates</a>   for details on the formats used. Batch templates can be edited using the submenu   in Mesquite's Edit menu, or from the Export Matrices &amp; Batch Files or Export   Batch Files dialog boxes.</P><P>The pre-defined templates can be viewed and duplicated, but not renamed or   edited. Their duplicates can be renamed and edited.</P><h4><a name="codesnippets"></a>Code Snippets</h4><P>Code snippets are designed as file-specific elements that are to be used in   place of tagged elements in the batch templates. For example, if in a batch   template the following text appeared:</P><pre>   exec setParameterValues;   &lt;snippet&gt;search command&lt;/snippet&gt;   display all;</pre><p>then within the Mesquite file you could store a code snippet called &quot;search   command&quot; whose contents would be inserted in place of the above text when   the batch file was created. If the text of &quot;search command&quot; was</p><pre>   hsearch nreps=100 addseq=random swap=tbr;</pre><P>then the batch file, when written, would contain</P><pre>   exec setParameterValues;   hsearch nreps=100 addseq=random swap=tbr;   display all;</pre><p>Batch templates can be edited using the Batch File Templates submenu in Mesquite's   Edit menu, or from the Export Matrices &amp; Batch Files or Export Batch Files   dialog boxes.</p><h4><a name="chartresults"></a>Chart Results via Instruction File</h4><P>If you have a text file on disk containing tab-delimited data, you can design   a Mesquite Instruction file that will give Mesquite enough information about   the data file to allow Mesquite to read it. See <a href="instructions.html">Instructions   File Format</a> for details about the way Mesquite Instruction files are to   be structured.</P><P>Some of the batch templates distributed with Mesquite have instruction files   defined within them.</P><H3><a name=examples></a>Examples</H3><p>See the <a href="../../../docs/mesquite/RandomSimul/RandomSimul.html">Simulations   and Randomizations</a> page of the Mesquite manual for examples.</p><H3>Citation</H3><P> Maddison, D.R., &amp; W.P.
