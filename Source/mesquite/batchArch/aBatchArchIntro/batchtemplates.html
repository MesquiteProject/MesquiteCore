The following codes included in these fields will be   replaced in the batch file as follows:</P><ul>  <li>&lt;name&gt; will be replaced by the text entered in the &quot;base name&quot;     field in the Export Matrices &amp; Batch Files or Export Batch Files dialog     boxes.</li>  <li>&lt;tree&gt; will be replaced by the Newick formatted text description of     the tree chosen in the Export Matrices &amp; Batch Files or Export Batch Files     dialog boxes.</li>  <li>&lt;snippet&gt;&lt;/snippet&gt; surrounding the name of a code snippet will     be replaced by the text of the code snippet</li>  <li>&lt;fileExtension&gt; will be replaced by the extension (with dot, if present;     e.g., &quot;.nex&quot;, &quot;.ss&quot;) that Mesquite will write based upon     the matrix format. </li>  <li>&lt;matrixFormat&gt; will be replaced by the name of the matrix format (e.g.,     &quot;NEXUS file&quot;)</li>  <li>&lt;random&gt; numValues=n lowerBound=b1 upperBound=b2 type=double|long     withReplacement=yes|no &lt;/random&gt; will be replaced by n random numbers     chosen with a uniform distribution over the range b1 through b2 inclusive,     with replacement or not. The numbers are either real numbers (if type=double     is chosen) or integers (type=long). For example, &lt;random&gt;numValues=3     lowerBound=1 upperBound=100 type=long withReplacement=no&lt;/random&gt; entered     in the repeated text field might be replaced by &quot;86 42 23&quot; in one     replicate, and &quot;5 73 31&quot; in the next replicate. </li></ul><P>For the field &quot;Repeated text, written for each replicate&quot;, the following   replacement will also be made:</P><ul>  <li>&lt;number&gt; will be replaced by the number of the replicate</li></ul><P>For example, consider 5 replicates run with a base name of &quot;matrix&quot;   for a template with the following specification:</P><P align="center"><img src="templateeg.gif" width="445" height="270"></P><P>A file called &quot;commands.nex&quot; would be created by Mesquite that would   look like this:</P><P>&nbsp;</P><pre>  #NEXUS  begin paup;        set autoclose nowarnreset nowarntree nowarntsave;        execute 'matrix1.nex';        hs;        savetrees file = 'maxtrix1.nex';        execute 'matrix2.nex';        hs;        savetrees file = 'matrix2.nex';        execute 'matrix3.nex';        hs;        savetrees file = 'matrix3.nex';        execute 'matrix4.nex';        hs;        savetrees file = 'matrix4.nex';        execute 'matrix5.nex';        hs;        savetrees file = 'matrix5.nex';  end;</pre><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Up to five separate batch files can be specified for any one Batch File Template.</P><p>The &quot;Format of Matrices&quot; choice will be ignored if matrices are not   being exported (e.g., if Export Batch Files was chosen).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P><HR></P><P>&copy; David Maddison &amp; Wayne Maddison, 2003</P></BODY></HTML>
