      Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
  <br>
      Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
      59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA<br>
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
  <br>
      [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts<br>
      as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
      the version number 2.1.]<br>
  <br>
      Preamble<br>
  <br>
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
      freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
      Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
      free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
  <br>
      This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
      specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
      Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You<br>
      can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
      this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
      strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
                  <br>
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
      not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
      you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
      for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
      it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
      it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
      these things.<br>
  <br>
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
      distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
      rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
      you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
  <br>
      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
      or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
      you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
      code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
      complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
      with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
      it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
  <br>
      We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
      library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
      permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
  <br>
      To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
      there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is<br>
      modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
      that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
      author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
      introduced by others.<br>
  <br>
      Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
      any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
      effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
      restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that<br>
      any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
      consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
  <br>
      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
      ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
      General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
      is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use<br>
      this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
      libraries into non-free programs.<br>
  <br>
      When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
      a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
      combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary<br>
      General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
      entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General<br>
      Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
      the library.<br>
  <br>
      We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because
      it<br>
      does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
      Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
      of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages<br>
      are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
      libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
      special circumstances.<br>
  <br>
      For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
      encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
      a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
      allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free<br>
      library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this<br>
      case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
      software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
  <br>
      In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
      programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
      free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
      non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
      operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
      system.<br>
  <br>
      Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
      users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
      linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
      that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
  <br>
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
      modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
  &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.
  The<br>
      former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
      be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
      GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
  <br>
      0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
      program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
      other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
      this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).<br>
      Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br>
  <br>
      A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
      prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
      (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
  <br>
      The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or
      work<br>
      which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the<br>
      Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
      copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
      portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
      straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
      included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
      making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means<br>
      all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
      interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
      and installation of the library.<br>
  <br>
      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
      covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br>
      running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
      such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
      on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
      writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
      and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
  <br>
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
      complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
      you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
      appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
      all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
      warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
      Library.<br>
  <br>
      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
      and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
      fee.<br>
  <br>
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
      of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
      distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
      above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
  <br>
      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
  <br>
      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
  <br>
      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
      charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
  <br>
      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
      the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
      is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
      in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
      table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
      its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
  <br>
      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
      application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
      application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
      root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
  <br>
      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br>
      identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
      and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
      themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
      sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br>
      distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
      on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
      this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
      entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
      it.<br>
  <br>
      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
      your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
      exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
      collective works based on the Library.<br>
  <br>
      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
      with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
      a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
      the scope of this License.<br>
  <br>
      3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
      License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do<br>
      this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
      that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
      instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
      ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
      that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in<br>
      these notices.<br>
  <br>
      Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
      that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
      subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
  <br>
      This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
      the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
  <br>
      4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
      derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
      under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
      it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
      must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
      medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
  <br>
      If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
      from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
      source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
      distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
      compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
  <br>
      5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
      Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
      linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such
      a<br>
      work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
      therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
  <br>
      However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library<br>
      creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
      contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the<br>
      library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
      Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
  <br>
      When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header
      file<br>
      that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
      derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
      Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
      linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The<br>
      threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
  <br>
      If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
      structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
      functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
      file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
      work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
      Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
  <br>
      Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
      distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
      Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
      whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
  <br>
      6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
      link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce
      a<br>
      work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
      under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
      modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
      engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
  <br>
      You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
      Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
      this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work<br>
      during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
      copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
      directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one<br>
      of these things:<br>
  <br>
      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
      machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
      changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
      Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
      with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that<br>
      uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
      user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
      executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood<br>
      that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
      Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
      to use the modified definitions.)<br>
  <br>
      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
      Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
      copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
      rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
      will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
      the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
      interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
  <br>
      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
      least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
      specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
      than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
  <br>
      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
      from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
      specified materials from the same place.<br>
  <br>
      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
      materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
  <br>
      For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the<br>
      Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
      reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,<br>
      the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
      normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
      components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
      which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
      the executable.<br>
  <br>
      It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
      restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
      accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
      use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
      distribute.<br>
  <br>
      7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
      Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
      facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
      library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
      the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
      permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
  <br>
      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
      based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
      facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
      Sections above.<br>
  <br>
      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
      that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
      where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
  <br>
      8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
      the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any<br>
      attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
      distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
      rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,<br>
      or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
      terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
  <br>
      9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
      signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
      distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are<br>
      prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br>
      modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
      Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
      all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
      the Library or works based on it.<br>
  <br>
      10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
      Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
      original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
      subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br>
      restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
      You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
      this License.<br>
  <br>
      11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
      infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
      conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
      otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
      excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br>
      distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
      License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
      may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent<br>
      license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
      all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
      the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
      refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
  <br>
      If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
      particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
      and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
  <br>
      It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
      patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
      such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
      integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
      implemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br>
      generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
      through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
      system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
      to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
      impose that choice.<br>
  <br>
      This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
      be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
  <br>
      12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
      certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
      original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may
      add<br>
      an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
      so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
      excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
      written in the body of this License.<br>
  <br>
      13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
      versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
      Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
      but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
  <br>
      Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library<br>
      specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
  &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
      conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
      the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a<br>
      license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
      the Free Software Foundation.<br>
  <br>
      14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
      programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
      write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is<br>
      copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
      Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our<br>
      decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
      of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
      and reuse of software generally.<br>
  <br>
      NO WARRANTY<br>
  <br>
      15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
      WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
      EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
      OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
      ANY<br>
      KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
      IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
      PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
      LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
      THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
  <br>
      16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
      WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
      AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
      FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
      CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
      LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
      RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
      FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
      SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
      DAMAGES.<br>
  <br>
      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>

      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
  <br>
      If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
      possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
      everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting<br>
      redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of
      the<br>
      ordinary General Public License).<br>
  <br>
      To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is<br>
      safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
      convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
  &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
                  <br>
  &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
      Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
  <br>
      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
  <br>
      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU<br>
      Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
  <br>
      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA<br>
                  <br>
      Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
                  <br>
      You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
      school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,
      if<br>
      necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
  <br>
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
      library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br>
                  <br>
