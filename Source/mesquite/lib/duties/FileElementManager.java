Currently subclasses of this are *not*hired on the basis of being FileElementManager, but rather because they supplied anexusBlockTest object that allows the NEXUS interpreting module to figure out what blocksthey can read.  Thus, other modules than FileElementManager's can read and write NEXUS blocksand commands.  The class FileElementManager exists mostly to supply a default dutyname.  Example modules:class ManageAssumptionsBlock; class ManageMesquiteBlock; class ManageNotesBlock.  Others subclass subclasses(e.g. TreesManager).*/public abstract class FileElementManager extends MesquiteModule implements ElementManager   {	public boolean getSearchableAsModule(){		return false;	}  	 public Class getDutyClass() {   	 	return FileElementManager.class;   	 } 	public String getDutyName() { 		return "Manager of file elements";   	 }	/*.................................................................................................................*/	public abstract MesquiteModule showElement(FileElement e, CommandRecord commandRec);	/*.................................................................................................................*/	public void deleteElement(FileElement e){		MesquiteMessage.warnProgrammer("oops, " + getName() + " doesn't delete yet");	}	/*.................................................................................................................*/	/*introduced in 1. 06 to get around issue of sequence of ID assignments; this allows ID assignments to happen early in Mesquite block.	This method is called in the Mesquite block manager */  	 public Snapshot getIDSnapshot(MesquiteFile file) {  	 	return null;  	 }}
