/** Manages a type of FileElement and Reads and writes NEXUS block.  Currently subclasses of this are *not*
hired on the basis of being FileElementManager, but rather because they supplied a
nexusBlockTest object that allows the NEXUS interpreting module to figure out what blocks
they can read.  Thus, other modules than FileElementManager's can read and write NEXUS blocks
and commands.  The class FileElementManager exists mostly to supply a default dutyname.  Example modules:
class ManageAssumptionsBlock; class ManageMesquiteBlock; class ManageNotesBlock.  Others subclass subclasses
(e.g. TreesManager).*/
