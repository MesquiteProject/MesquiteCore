See its superclassCharMatrixObedSource for methods.  A Taxa object must be passed to the class's methods becausethe matrices that are relevant may be Taxa specific.  For instance, only some of the available data matricesin a file might apply to a given set of taxa, or a matrix may consist of all possible binary character distributions for a given set of taxa.<p>This class assumes there is a current matrix that is active, andavailable on request.<p>This class of modules is a simple subclass of CharMatrixObedSource.  The only reason for the distinction is to allow a module toknow why it was hired.  A CharMatrixObedSource is not to take control of which matrix is current; it is to allow itsemployers complete control.  Thus a CharMatrixObedSource should not add menu items for which data set is to be used.On the other hand, a CharMatrixSource can have such menu items and force a change to the next matrix.*/public abstract class CharMatrixSource extends CharMatrixOneSource  {   	 public Class getDutyClass() {   	 	return CharMatrixSource.class;   	 } 	public String getDutyName() { 		return "Character Matrix Source";   	 }   	 public String[] getDefaultModule() {   	 	return new String[] {"#StoredMatrices", "#SimulatedMatrix"};   	 }}
