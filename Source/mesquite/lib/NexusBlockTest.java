They are stored in modulesinfo and used to test, without having to employ the module, whether the module would be able to read a nexus block.  Thus, if a modulewants to read a particular sort of block, it overrides that MesquiteModule method getNexusBlockTest() so as to instantiate and returna NexusBlockTest object.  When the NEXUS file is being read and a block is found, the nexus file reading module (InterpretNEXUS) looks into the modulesinfo of all the modules and when it finds a NexusBlockTest object, it passes it the name of the block and the block itself, and the object returns whether it is readable by the module.  If so, the module is  hired and used to process the block.*/public abstract class NexusBlockTest  {	/**returns whether or not the module can deal with given block with the given blockName*/	public abstract boolean readsWritesBlock(String blockName, FileBlock block);  }
