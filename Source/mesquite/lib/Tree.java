/** This interface matches the readable methods of MesquiteTree, and was created so that translator classes could
be written that could access tree structures from other programs.  Most calculations are passed trees under the
guise of interface Tree, which allows these calculations to be used on tree structures other than MesquiteTree, and
which ensures they will not modify the tree.  Some modules that need to modify tree structures check to see whether the passed
Tree is an instance of AdjustableTree or MesquiteTree.  The change to using interfaces (from the previous system
which just passed MesquiteTree under the name Tree) was done Aug. 2000, and the change has not fully settled in yet.
