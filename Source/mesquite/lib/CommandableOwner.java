/** Interfact designed for modules so that they can claim to own or be associated with other Commandables.  When queried the module should
return an array of instantiated Commandables, from each of which can be accumulated its commands.  The purpose of this is for the automatic
accumulation of documentation of commands (see CommandChecker) to have access to Commandables other than the modules themselves.  Thus,
if a module uses the interface CommandableOwner and returns an array containing an instantiated copy of its special window type, the accumulator of
of command documentation can include the documentation for commands of that special window type within the documentation for the module itself.    */
