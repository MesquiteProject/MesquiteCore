/**An interface to signal that a CharacterDistribution can be changed (i.e. its states set, its parent data set, the number
of taxa readjusted, and so on.  Classes that implement this should override setParentData and setParentCharacter to
avoid their use, as AdjustableDistributions should not be dependent on a parent CharacterData.  
Some CharacterDistributions, such as those that report characters from stored matrices in
a CharacterData object, are not adjustable.
