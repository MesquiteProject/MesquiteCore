/*==========================  Mesquite Basic Class Library    ==========================*/
/*
Characters and their states are represented by various classes.  One, CharacterState, represents a single state of a character (e.g., the state of 
a terminal taxon).  <p>
The class CharacterData and its subclasses represent full datasets with a matrix, character names, and associated sets (model sets,
exclusion sets, etc.).  <p>
Subclasses of MCharactersStates represent a matrix of character X taxa (without associated names, sets, etc.), and are used
for temporary storage of a matrix or for the results of a reconstruction of character evolution in all characters.<p>
Subclasses of MCharactersStates represent an array of character states in a series of taxa or nodes ("M" for "Multiple", as opposed to the subclasses of
CharacterStates which refer to a single character).  The subclasses are:
	<li>MCharactersDistribution - The states in multiple characters in terminal taxa.  Often passed to modules so they can calculate on it.
		<ul>
		<li>MCategoricalDistribution - for categorical characters.
			<ul><li>MCategoricalAdjustable - used for stand-alone characters, such as those coming from a simulation.  Size can be adjusted & states altered.
			<li>MCategoricalEmbedded - used as a reference to amatrix in an existing CharacterData object.
			</ul>
		<li>MContinuousDistribution
			<ul><li>MContinuousAdjustable - used for stand-alone characters, such as those coming from a simulation.  Size can be adjusted & states altered.
			<li>MContinuousEmbedded - used as a reference to a matrix in an existing CharacterData object.
			</ul>
		</ul>
	<li>MCharactersHistory - states at the internal and terminal nodes of a tree.  Returned by reconstruction modules.
			<ul><li>MCategoricalHistory - for categorical characters
			<li>MContinuousHistory - for continuous characters.
			</ul>
<p>
Subclasses of CharacterStates represent a vector of character states in a single character in a series of taxa or nodes.  The subclasses are:
	<li>CharacterDistribution - The states in terminal taxa.  Often passed to modules so they can calculate on it.
		<ul>
		<li>CategoricalDistribution - for a categorical character.
			<ul><li>CategoricalAdjustable - used for stand-alone character, such as that coming from a simulation.  Size can be adjusted & states altered.
			<li>CategoricalEmbedded - used as a reference to a character in an existing CharacterData object.
			</ul>
		<li>ContinuousDistribution
			<ul><li>ContinuousAdjustable - used for stand-alone character, such as that coming from a simulation.  Size can be adjusted & states altered.
			<li>ContinuousEmbedded - used as a reference to a character in an existing CharacterData object.
			</ul>
		</ul>
	<li>CharacterHistory - states at the internal and terminal nodes of a tree.  Returned by reconstruction modules.
			<ul><li>CategoricalHistory - for a categorical character
			<li>ContinuousHistory - for a continuous character.
			</ul>
