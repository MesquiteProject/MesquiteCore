To build the Mesquite executable for older macOSs.
LAST USE AND VERSION Jan 2018


First, build Mesquite.jar that is used as a starter:

0. Make sure ant is installed.  (You can install Homebrew, and then use “brew install ant”)
0. Make sure you have the appropriate version of ByteBuddy.  
	If you need a new version, then unpack the jar using
		jar xf byte-buddy-agent-1.7.8.jar   [this should yield a "net" directory]

1. get the lastest start.Mesquite.java from the Mesquite Workspace, and use it to replace the one in src/start/ here.

2. cd into this directory then give this command:

ant

3. The Mesquite.jar will be placed in dist/.  This can be moved into Mesquite_Folder as a starter, or into the Mesquite application bundle.

4. to incorporate ByteBuddy:
	-move net into dist
	- cd into dist
	jar uf Mesquite.jar net/bytebuddy/agent/*
	-move net out of dist


4. The latest unsigned application bundle is also here (Mesquite-appBundle.app). Replace its internal mesquite.jar as needed (note it needs to be lowercase "m"). It was built ca. 2014 by appBundler from Oracle. We have yet to get the javaPackager from Oracle to work.
