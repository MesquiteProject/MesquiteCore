To Run Mesquite on Linux

(For further questions, please feel free to post on the Mesquite Google group https://groups.google.com/g/mesquite-project)

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
To start Mesquite, you need Java installed.  We strongly recommend Java 21 or later. Some functions will work only if you have Java 17 or later. The absolute minimum is Java 9. We have tested Mesquite under the JDK version available from oracle.com (e.g., try searching "download java jdk oracle").

RUNNING MESQUITE
Run Mesquite by double clicking mesquite.sh, right-click selecting it and choosing Run As A Program, or running mesquite.sh from the command line like this:
	./mesquite.sh

You may want to edit the .sh file to request more memory using  options like "-Xmx8000M -Xss8m" (see below).

Alternatively, run it from the command line by cd'ing into Mesquite_Folder and then giving a command like this:

   java -Xmx1000M -Xss4m -Djava.library.path=lib -Djri.ignore.ule="yes" -jar Mesquite.jar

The part -Xmx1000M indicates how much heap memory to give to Mesquite in general. With more heap memory Mesquite can handle more trees, bigger matrices, bigger charts, and so on.

The part -Xss4m indicates how much stack memory to give to each thread.  With more stack memory, Mesquite can handle bigger trees, e.g. more than 5000 taxa.  To be able to handle 10000 taxa, you may need to increase this to 4m or more.

Here is an example configuration:

	java -Xmx4000M -Xss16m -d64 -Djava.library.path=lib -Djri.ignore.ule="yes" -jar Mesquite.jar

This gives much memory to Mesquite, but 4000 MB (= 4 GB) memory exceeds the ability of 32 bit Java.  For that reason the command -d64 was added, to indicate you want to use 64 bit java.  

If you run Mesquite directly from the command line, you can replace “java” by the full path to the Java executable.
