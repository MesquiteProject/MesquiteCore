              <h2>Mesquite's standard modules</h2>
              <p>The following is a list of the modules installed by default in 
                this version of Mesquite, along with the explanations of what 
                they do.</p>
              <ul>
<li>ACGT Compositional Bias &#8212; Returns continuous characters which are the proportion G+C, and separately A, C, G, T, for each taxon in a DNA data set.</li>
<li>Add item... &#8212; Adds an item in each cell of a continuous matrix.</li>

<li>Add Noise to Branch Lengths &#8212; Adds noise to branch lengths of tree.  Noise is Normally distributed, with variance as selected.  By default the variance is be proportional to current branch length, so that if branch length is 10 and you've indicated a variance multiplier of 0.1, the noise added will have a variance of 1.0.  Negative branch lengths are not allowed, and are changed to zero.</li>

<li>Tree value using character matrix &#8212; Calculates a value for the tree using a character data matrix.</li>
<li>Tree Window &#8212; Makes a basic tree window, which contains a tool palette.  Hires assistants for the tree window (e.g., Trace Character).</li>
<li>Tree Window Coordinator &#8212; Coordinates the creation of basic tree windows.</li>
<li>TreeBase &#8212; Provides a URL to a taxon in TreeBase</li>
<li>Treelength &#8212; Calculates the parsimony length of a tree.</li>
<li>Treelength  &#8212; Calculates the parsimony treelength of a given tree and matrix.</li>
<li>Trees &amp; Diversification Characters &#8212; Evolves a series of trees, each tied to a single character controlling diversification rates.</li>
<li>Trees List &#8212; Makes windows listing trees and information about them.</li>
<li>Trees Package Introduction &#8212; Serves as an introduction to the basic trees package for Mesquite.</li>
<li>Trees Scattergram &#8212; Makes a scatterplot displaying two values (such as likelihoods, parsimony scores, imbalance statistics, correlations,etc.) for a series of trees.</li>
<li>Trim Terminal Gap Characters &#8212; Trims characters at edges of matrix that are gaps only.</li>
<li>Trim Terminal Incomplete Codons &#8212; Trims any incomplete codons from the start and end of each sequence.</li>
<li>Truncate taxon names &#8212; Truncates taxon names.</li>
<li>Type of character data matrix &#8212; Indicates type of character data matrix (e.g., continuous, DNA, etc.).</li>
<li>Type of Model &#8212; Indicates type of model (e.g., Mk1, step-matrix) in list window.</li>
<li>uBio &#8212; Provides a URL to a taxon in uBio</li>
<li>Ultrametricize &#8212; Adjusts a tree's branch lengths so that the distances among terminal taxa are ultrametric (i.e. like a molecular clock, all tips reaching to same level).  This is not done with any sophisticated smoothing algorithm; rather, branches are just stretched until they reach to same level.</li>
<li>Unambiguous Changes &#8212; Counts number of unambiguous changes along branch below based upon the character reconstruction.</li>
<li>Uncorrected (p) distance (DNA) &#8212; Uncorrected (p) distance from a DNA matrix.</li>
<li>Uncorrected Distance (General) &#8212; Uncorrected (p) distance from a character matrix.</li>
<li>Uniform speciation (Yule) &#8212; Generates tree by simple uniform probability speciation (a Yule process) as done by Harding (1971).  The chance of speciation is equal for all tips.</li>
<li>Uniform Speciation with Sampling &#8212; Generates tree by simple uniform probability speciation (a Yule process), with subsequent sampling of species.</li>
<li>Unique ID (characters) &#8212; Shows unique id assigned to character.</li>
<li>Unique ID (taxa) &#8212; Shows unique id assigned to taxon.</li>
<li>Unique IDs default &#8212; Sets the preferences for storing unique ids.</li>
<li>Unroot tree &#8212; Sets the tree to unrooted.</li>
<li>UPGMA &#8212; Supplies trees obtained from UPGMA clustering.</li>
<li>Use Trees from Separate File &#8212; Supplies trees directly from a file, without bringing the contained tree block entirely into memory.  This is a special purpose module designed to allow much larger blocks of trees to be used within constraints of memory, but will make some calculations slower.  Except for this special use, we recommend you use Include or Link from the file menu to access external tree files.  This module does NOT copy the trees into your main data file, and so if you save your main data file then move it or the tree file, the data file will no longer be able to find the trees.  This module does not know how many trees are in the file, and hence may attempt to read files beyond the number in the file.</li>
<li>User-Specified Nucleotide Frequency Model &#8212; Defines and maintains user-specified nucleotide frequency models.</li>
<li>Utilities &#8212; Provides a menu for utilities</li>
<li>Value for 2 characters with current tree &#8212; Coordinates the calculation of a number for two characters based on a current tree.</li>
<li>Value from Tree &#8212; Calculates a value for each taxon using a tree.</li>
<li>Values for Nodes &#8212; Shows on a drawn tree various possible numbers at the nodes.</li>
<li>Variable among taxa &#8212; Selects characters that are variable among the selected taxa</li>
<li>Web page link &#8212; Provides a window to jump to a web page</li>
<li>Whole or Submodel &#8212; Indicates whether model is a complete or partial model of character evolution.</li>
<li>Window Holder &#8212; Helps other modules by holding their windows.</li>
<li>With probability p &#8212; Selects characters randomly with probability p.</li>
<li>Within-group PCA &#8212; Performs within-group principal components analysis on a continous-valued matrix.</li>
