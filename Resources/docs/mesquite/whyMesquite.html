give two answers, the <a href="#practical">practical</a> and                 the <a href="#poetic">poetic</a>, and a comment on the relationship                 between <a href="#macclade">MacClade and Mesquite</a>.</p>              <p>               <h3><a name="practical"></a>The practical answer</h3>              <p>Mesquite represents a new approach to computing for evolutionary                 biology. In recent years there has been a proliferation of computer                 programs for phylogenetic analysis, each designed for some particular                 analysis (e.g., see <a href="http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/software.html">Felsenstein's                 compilation</a> of programs). As these often involve unique file                 formats and user interfaces, it is difficult for users to move                 from one to another. Users tend to become constrained to a few                 familiar analyses, since any given program can't do everything,                 and each program has costs in learning. As a programmer one would                 like to respond by making a program that does everything, but                 there are now too many analyses available or conceivable for a                 single programmer or programming team to keep up. We have seen                 the impact of these constraints with MacClade: some users perform                 particular analyses in MacClade not because they are the most                 appropriate analyses for their questions, but simply because they                 are available in a familiar program. We would like to add more                 flexibility to MacClade, but in a monolithic program this can                 be difficult to do, and even if easy, there are more proposed                 methods than we could maintain in MacClade.</p>              <p>Hence, our goal was to design a general system for phylogenetic                 computing to which different programmers could contribute modules.                 Bringing different analytical tools into a common system increases                 possible analyses more than additively. In the end, the system                 has grown beyond being strictly phylogenetic, including capabilities                 for calculations involving characteristics of many organisms (e.g.                 population genetics and morphometrics) that need not involve phylogeny.</p>              <p>A second goal of Mesquite is to provide a graphical user interface                 that will operate, more or less without modification, under different                 operating systems (being written in Java).</p>              <h4>Modularity and Flexibility</h4>              <p>&quot;Modularity&quot; in computer progamming might follow different                 models. It could follow the &quot;<a href="http://www.mrpotatohead.com">Mr.                 Potato Head</a>&quot; model, in which there is a central program                 to which different peripheral calculations can be attached in                 specific places. This allows useful, but limited, flexibility.                 Or, modularity could follow the &quot;<a href="http://www.lego.com">Lego</a>&quot;                 model, in which building blocks are attached to other building                 blocks, and so on indefinitely. This allows nearly unlimited flexibility.                 Mesquite's modularity is somewhat of a hybrid between these: there                 is a (small) central starting point to which modules attach, but                 from there modules can be attached to modules attached to modules,                 indefinitely, leading to considerable flexibility in the analyses                 that can be constructed.</p>              <p>To give an idea of the flexibility, consider the calculation                 of the parsimony score of a tree, the treelength. A treelength                 calculating module takes as input information a tree, and responds                 by returning its length. Such a module belongs to the general                 class of modules that return a number when passed a tree. Other                 modules belonging to this class (&quot;NumberForTree&quot;) could                 return the likelihood of the tree, or a measure of the asymmetry                 of the tree's branching, or a measure of the tree's discordance                 with a containing species tree. A Tree Legend module can be written                 (and has been) that displays the treelength in a legend in the                 tree window, but the Legend module is designed so that the user                 can choose to display any other number for the tree, such as its                 likelihood, asymmetry, or discordance. If a programmer creates                 a new module to calculate a number for a tree such as the longest                 branch-length path from root to tip, and a user installs the module,                 then the longest path measurement would automatically become another                 option for the tree legend.</p>              <p>The Tree Legend is not the only place where analyses could use                 numbers for trees. A charting module could display the numbers                 calculated for a whole series of trees, or a tree search module                 could use the numbers to find a tree with minimum or maximum values                 for the number. When such modules are made, they can automatically                 have access to whatever NumberForTree modules are available. Thus,                 the chart could show treelength, or likelihood, or asymmetry,                 or discordance, or longest path. Likewise, the tree search module                 could seek to optimize any of those. If a programmer makes a new                 module to analyze numbers for trees, then suddenly all existing                 NumberForTree modules have a new context in which they can be                 analyzed. If a new NumberForTree module is made, it will appear                 as a new option under each of the modules making use of NumberForTree.                 Hence the number of alternative analyses rises as the product                 of numbers of modules of different interacting types.</p>              <p>Of course, the trees used had to come from somewhere. One module                 might supply the trees stored in a file, another might simulate                 trees using a simple markovian model of speciation and extinction,                 another might simulate trees as gene trees coalescing within a                 species tree. Characters likewise might come from a stored matrix,                 or might be simulated by a stochastic module of evolution, or                 might represent reshufflings of existing characters. This means                 that any calculations using trees or characters can either do                 their calculations on observed data and reconstructed trees, or                 can derive null distributions under stochastic models. The calculations                 don't have to do anything special to achieve this flexibility;                 they simply let the user choose the sources of trees and characters.</p>              <p>(For more details about modularity, see <a href="howMesquiteWorks.html">How                 Mesquite works</a>)</p>              <h4>A community of programmers</h4>              <p>Our hope is that building-block style of the Mesquite system                 will encourage programmers to write modules for their own favorite                 analyses. Another attraction of the Mesquite system is that many                 of the details of reading and writing of files, user interface                 and graphical display are already taken care of, and the programmer                 might worry only about a single calculation. The system is built                 in Java and is therefore platform independent. It is also possible                 for programmers to link in code written in C, C++, or some other                 language.</p>              <p>We have attempted to design the system so that a programmer's                 efforts can be recognized as an independent, citable contribution.                 Modules or suites of modules can have their own names, own manuals,                 be distributed and cited separately. They simply run within the                 Mesquite system.</p>              <p>Mesquite source code is available for <a href="http://mesquiteProject.org/mesquite/download/source.html">download</a>.                 This allows other programmers to modify existing source to create                 new modules.</p>              <p>               <hr></p>              <h3><a name="poetic"></a>The poetic answer</h3>              <p>The goals of Mesquite are these:</p>              <p><b>To change the economics of imagination in evolutionary biology</b>                 &#151; There are three ways we envision Mesquite stimulating imaginative                 ideas and their successful spread:</p>              <ul>                <li><u>Stimulating the creation of ideas: analyses</u>. With multiple                   alternative modules available for various parts of an analysis,                   and with modules specializing in questions from various branches                   of evolutionary biology (e.g., phylogenetics, molecular evolution,                   population genetics, geometric morphometrics) the diversity                   and scope of analyses that can be constructed by combining different                   modules is great. Individual users can carry their imaginations                   through to an analysis that no one has tried previously. Indeed,                   Mesquite, by offering the alternatives to be combined, doesn't                   merely provide analytical tools for questions that have existed:                   it suggests and provokes new questions.                 <li><u>Stimulating the creation of ideas: biology</u>. As does                   <a href="http://macclade.org">MacClade</a>, Mesquite has an                   emphasis on visualization and exploration. An idea &#151; whether                   a particular hypothesis about the evolutionary history of a                   group, or a stochastic model of a process &#151; can be followed                   through to its consequences, and visualized. A biologist can                   ask &quot;What if this were the phylogenetic tree?&quot; and                   a character's evolution can be reconstructed or simulated on                   this tree, and the results visualized. A biologist can ask &quot;What                   if the population had population sizes fluctuating in this way?&quot;,                   and coalescence can be simulated, and the results visualized.                   In providing users with the tool to ask &quot;What if?&quot;                   questions, Mesquite provides an extension of the imagination.                   Such tools are vital in a field whose ideas have consequences                   that are difficult to predict or grasp without the aid of a                   computer.                 <li><u>Enhancing the efficient distribution of ideas: programs</u>.                   The imagination of theoreticians and programmers has produced                   many valuable ideas for approaches and methods, and many valuable                   programs to implement them. However, some of the ideas haven't                   been translated to programs, and many of the programs haven't                   been as much explored and used as would have been good. We don't                   know, as a field, how many important ideas will lie unused for                   decades until they are rediscovered. By allowing the programmer                   to focus on the precise idea proposed (Mesquite providing much                   of the housekeeping code for the programmer), Mesquite may allow                   some ideas, that might never have been implemented, to be realized                   as tools. By providing a fairly user-friendly context in which                   modules can operate, Mesquite may encourage some programs to                   be used more broadly and more easily than otherwise.               </ul>              <p><b>To continue to promote a phylogenetic perspective in evolutionary                 biology</b> &#151; The last few decades have seen the realization                 of the importance of viewing organismal diversity and evolution                 in the light of phylogeny. This revolution is analogous to and                 as fundamental to its field as the revolution in cosmology from                 a Newtonian view of space to an Einsteinian view of space (Maddison                 and P&eacute;rez, 2000). Just as mass curves space, phylogeny                 has curved the space of biological diversity, providing a distortion                 on the distribution of traits of organisms we see around us. MacClade                 and Mesquite are both designed to provide a corrective lens, to                 help us to see organisms and their traits in their natural orientation                 within this curved space along the phylogeny. Mesquite's modularity                 allows this perspective to be extended to fields such as morphometrics,                 in which a phylogenetic perspective has relatively recently begun                 to suffuse the field.</p>              <p>               <hr></p>              <h3><a name="macclade"></a>Which to use, Mesquite or MacClade?</h3>              <p><a href="http://www.macclade.org">Version 4 of MacClade</a> (Maddison                 &amp; Maddison, 2000) was released in October 2000, and the MacOS                 X compatible version 4.04 in July 2002. (It is now at version                 4.08.) The reader might wonder why we have been working on two                 different programming efforts, and whether they are intended for                 different uses. Although Mesquite's extensibility means that it                 has many more features than MacClade, MacClade has some features                 that Mesquite lacks. Calculations and functions of MacClade's                 tree window not currently available in Mesquite include particular                 charts (e.g., Changes and Stasis), equivocal cycling, the concentrated                 changes test, some of the parsimony options (irreversible, stratigraphic,                 Dollo), a detailed Trace All Changes mode, and some options for                 tree printing (e.g., saving a tree to the clipboard). For some                 users the most significant advantages of MacClade 4 over MacClade                 3 are in the data editor, where editing of molecular sequences                 is more sophisticated, with better tools for manual sequence alignment                 and on-the-fly translation to amino acids. We cannot predict when                 these features will be available in Mesquite. MacClade also has                 a simpler interface, which some users might prefer. We imagine                 that in the long-term future MacClade will give way to Mesquite                 as Mesquite matures. For the next several years, however, the                 two will coexist and be complementary. </p>              <h3>References </h3>              <p> Maddison, D.R. and W.P. Maddison. 2000.
