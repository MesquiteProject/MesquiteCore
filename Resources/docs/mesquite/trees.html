              <h2>Phylogenetic trees</h2>
              <p>Phylogenetic trees represent the branching history of descent 
                linking taxa, whether these taxa are species or genes. In Mesquite, 
                a tree refers to the taxa in a particular <a href="taxa.html">taxa 
                block</a> and once created cannot be transfered to refer a different 
                taxa block. (As explained in the page on <a href="taxa.html">taxa</a>, 
                &quot;taxon&quot; here is used as shorthand for &quot;terminal 
                taxon&quot; or &quot;OTU&quot;.)</p>
              <h3> <a name="characteristics"></a>Characteristics of trees</h3>
              <p>Mesquite typically treats trees as rooted, although it is possible 
                to de-root trees. Trees may contain polytomies (multifurcations) 
                and also unbranched internal nodes. A tree in Mesqite does not 
                need to contain all of the taxa in the taxa block, and indeed 
                can contain as few as one taxon. Unlike MacClade, Mesquite does 
                not support trees with observed taxa fixed in ancestral position. 
                Mesquite can read, edit and write branch lengths in trees. In 
                addition to length, a branch may have various other attributes 
                such as width (e.g. for effective population size in population 
                genetics) and color (for display purposes).</p>
              <p>Polytomies in trees are interpreted either as &quot;soft&quot; 
                (uncertainty in resolution) or &quot;hard&quot; (simultaneous 
                divergence). The default interpetation is specified in the Defaults 
                submenu of the File menu. A change in this default applies to all projects and 
                files. Individual trees can be marked as using a specific assumption, 
                thus overriding the default (e.g., by using the Set Polytomy Assumption 
                menu items in the Alter/Transform Tree submenu of the Tree menu 
                of the Tree Window). The appropriate assumption for most phylogenetic 
                studies is &quot;soft&quot;, but calculations using soft polytomies 
                are extremely difficult, and most Mesquite calculations yield 
                results only with dichotomous trees and those with hard polytomies.</p>
              <h3> <a name="analyzing"></a>Analyzing trees</h3>
              <p>Trees can be visualized in various tree windows, and statistics 
                about them presented in <a href="#treewindow">tree windows</a>, 
                the <a href="#listoftrees">List of Trees</a> window, and in <a href="charts.html">charts</a>. 
                We will not attempt to summarize all of the options here, which 
                are discussed elsewhere, in particular in the analysis links at 
                left. </p>
              <p><strong>Tree comparison methods</strong> include the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> <a name="treeToTree"></a><strong>Tree to tree similarity measures</strong> &#8212; 
                  The Shared Partitions module measures the number of partitions 
                  between taxa shared by two trees. The separately-available <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/treeviz/">TSV</a> 
                  package includes other measures such as the Robinson-Foulds 
                  metric.</li>
                <li> <a name="consensus"></a><strong>Consensus trees</strong> &#8212; This is not available 
                  standardly in Mesquite, but can be added with the TSV package, 
                  which includes strict consensus trees.</li>
                <li> <a name="fitTrees"></a><strong>Fits of trees into trees</strong> &#8212; The fit 
                  of a contained tree (e.g. gene or parasite) into a containing 
                  tree (e.g. species or host) can be measured by <a href="popGen/popGen.html#deep">Deep 
                  Coalescence</a> in the coalesce package.</li>
                <li> <a name="instability"></a><strong>Taxon instability among trees</strong> &#8212; This 
                  module measures for each taxon how variable are its relationships 
                  among a set of trees. Taxa that are particulary unstable, i.e. 
                  whose placement is especially variable from tree to tree, score 
                  high on this index. Taxon instability calculations are illustrated 
                  in the example file at Mesquite_Folder/examples/Basic_Examples/tree_manipulation/13-instability.nex</li>
              </ul>
              <h3> <a name="storedTrees"></a>Stored trees and tree blocks<font face="Trebuchet MS"> </font></h3>
              <font face="Trebuchet MS"> 
              <p>Trees may exist within <strong>tree blocks</strong> that are 
                stored in the data file. A tree block is a collection of trees 
                stored as a unit. A single data file may contain more than one 
                tree block, each containing from one to many trees.</p>
              <p>Mesquite calculations can use trees other than those stored in 
                tree blocks in a data file. Most calculations can use trees that 
                are temporarily created using simulations or randomizations specifically 
                for the purpose of the calculation and then discarded. Also, a 
                recently edited tree in the Tree Window might not be stored in 
                the file if the user has not explicitly stored it in the file 
                using &quot;Store Tree&quot; or &quot;Store Tree As&quot;. More 
                details on storing trees in tree blocks in the file are given 
                <a href="#storing">below</a>. </p>
              </font> 
              <p>To create a new, empty tree block into which to store trees, 
                select <font size="-1"><u>Taxa&amp;Trees&gt;New Empty Block of 
                Trees...</u></font> A new block of trees is automatically created 
                if you ask in the Tree Window to store a tree and no block has 
                yet been created to receive trees.</p>
              <p>It is also possible to create tree blocks that are already filled 
                with trees. For instance, if you want to make a duplicate of an 
                existing tree block, select <font size="-1"><u>Taxa&amp;Trees&gt;Make 
                New Trees Block from&gt;Stored Trees</u></font>. Other choices 
                under <u><font size="-1">Taxa&amp;Trees&gt;Make New Trees Block 
                from&gt;</font></u> allow you to create tree blocks filled with 
                trees resulting from simulations or randomizations, or other tree 
                sources.</p>
              <p><a name="listoftrees"></a>Trees stored in a tree block can be 
                renamed or deleted in the <strong>List of Trees window</strong> 
                (available in the Taxa&amp;Trees menu). To rename, edit the tree's 
                name in the list directly. To delete a tree, select the tree's 
                row in the list window and choose <font size="-1"><u>List&gt;Delete 
                Selected Trees</u></font>. Statistics about trees can also be 
                viewed in the List of Trees window by adding the appropriate columns 
                using the List menu.</p>
              <font face="Trebuchet MS"> 
              <p>Tree blocks stored in a file can be renamed or deleted in the 
                List of Tree Blocks window (available in the Taxa&amp;Trees menu). 
                To rename, edit the tree block's name in the list directly. To 
                delete a tree block, select the tree block's row in the list window 
                and choose <font size="-1"><u>List&gt;Delete Selected Tree Blocks</u></font>.</p>
              <p>For tree files with too many trees to be held in memory simultaneously, 
                Mesquite can read the trees in directly from the file, one at 
                a time, and discard each from memory after it is used (for instance, 
                in charts or in the Tree Window). To do this use &quot;Use Trees from Separate File&quot; as your tree source.</p>
              <h3><a name="treesources"></a>Tree Sources</h3>
              <p>Trees for viewing and analysis can come from various sources, 
                including tree blocks in the current file, or <a href="RandomSimul/simTrees.html">simulations</a>. 
                Some tree sources modify other trees, such as <strong>Randomly 
                Modify Current Tree</strong>. <strong>Use Trees from Separate File</strong> 
                is useful for large treefiles. Although slow at times, it does 
                not store all the trees in Mesquite's memory, but instead gets 
                them from the file one at a time as needed. Another tree source, 
                <a href="otherPrograms.html#mrbayestrees">MrBayes Trees</a>, obtains 
                trees directly from a tree file stored by MrBayes. Mesquite can 
                updated its calculations as new trees come in from MrBayes.</p>
              <h3><a name="filtering"></a>Filtering Trees</h3>
              <p>Trees used in charts, the tree window or to make a new tree block 
                can be filtered. To do this, select Filter Trees from Other source 
                as your source of trees. You will be asked for the original source 
                of trees, and the filtering method. There are currently three 
                filtering methods:</p>
              <p> 
              <ul>
                <li>Selected Taxa Form Clade - retains only those trees in which 
                  the currently selected set of taxa form a clade on the tree</li>
                <li>Selected Taxa Convex in Tree - retains only those trees in 
                  which the currently selected set of taxa can be form a clade 
                  by rerooting the tree</li>
                <li>Tree Value Satisfies Criterion - retains only those trees 
                  whose value is greater than, less than or equal to a particular 
                  target value. For &quot;value&quot;, one can use any of the 
                  available calculations that assign numbers to trees, such as 
                  treelength, tree depth, likelihood in character, tree asymmetry, 
                  and so on. The user is also asked what is the target value, 
                  and whether the criterion is to be greater than, less than or 
                  equal to the target.</li>

              <p>Trees can be edited by hand, as described <a href="#treewindow">below</a>, 
                or the user can request Mesquite to automatically modify trees 
                using the &quot;Alter/Transform&quot; modules. These modules can 
                be used:</p>
              <p> 
              <ul>
                <li>in the Tree menu of the Tree Window, under the Alter/Transform 
                  Tree submenu, or the Alter/Tranform Branch Lengths submenu. 
                  Selecting an item in these submenus performs the transformation 
                  on the tree in the Tree Window.</li>
                <li>in the List menu of the List of Trees window, in the Utilities 
                  submenu, in the Alter Trees or Alter Branch Lengths submenus. 
                  Selecting an item in these submenus performs the transformation 
                  on all selected trees, or on all trees if none is selected. 
                </li>
                <li>to transform trees on the fly that are being supplied for 
                  a chart or tree window or making a new tree block for a file. 
                  To do this, select &quot;Transform Trees from Other Source&quot; 
                  whenever a source of trees is required. You will be asked for 
                  a source of trees to be transformed or filtered, and then for 
                  a means by which to transform the trees.</li>
              </ul></p>
              <p>The Alter/Transform modules include:</p>
              <p> 
              <ul>
                <li>Root tree with selected taxa as outgroup</li>
                <li>Resolve Polytomies (to 0-length branches)</li>
                <li>Collapse Zero-length Branches</li>
                <li>Convert Negative Branch Lengths to Zero</li>
                <li>All Branch Lengths to 1</li>
                <li>Scale All Branch Lengths</li>
                <li>Ultrametricize</li>
              </ul></p>
              <p>To use &quot;Root tree with selected taxa as outgroup&quot;, 
                you first must select the outgroup taxa in, for example, the Taxa 
                List window. Then, choose the menu item &quot;Root tree with selected 
                taxa as outgroup&quot; in the Alter/Transform Tree submenu of 
                the Tree menu of the tree window, and in the Alter Trees submenu 
                of the Utilities submenu of the List menu of the List of Trees 
                window. This module will reroot the taxa in between the selected 
                outgroups and the remaining taxa, if this is possible. If the 
                tree cannot be rerooted so that the remaining taxa form a clade, 
                then the tree will not be rerooted, and a warning will be given 
                (perhaps visible only in the log). If the tree can be rerooted, 
                then both the outgroup and ingroup will be monophyletic on the 
                rerooted tree. In addition, if the tree has branch lengths specified, 
                the root will be positioned at the midway point along the branch 
                on which it is placed. That is, the length of the branch from 
                the root to the ingroup will be equal to the length of the branch 
                from the root to the outgroup. Future versions may allow user-choice 
                of the branch length distribution. Adjusting of the length of 
                the two basal branches is NOT done if the tree is already rooted 
                between the chosen outgroups and ingroup.</p>

              <h3><a name="treewindow"></a>Editing trees: The Basic Tree Window</h3>
              <p>The Tree Window shows a tree that can be edited and used in analyses. 
                A new Tree Window can be requested by selecting <font size="-1"><u>Taxa&amp;Trees&gt;New 
                Tree Window</u></font>. (Mesquite allows multple tree windows, 
                and so if you select this menu item a second time, you'll get 
                a new tree window.) Many of the Tree Window's fundamental functions 
                are controlled by its Tree menu. This menu contains items to select 
                the tree source, store trees, and alter the tree. A second important 
                menu is the Drawing menu, which controls the appearance of the 
                tree. Additional menu items related to the Tree Window are found 
                in the Analysis menu. 
              <h4> <a name="source"></a>Tree source</h4>
              <p>The Tree Window shows trees from a particular source (although 
                the tree being shown could differ from those in the tree source, 
                if you've recently modified the tree using the tools). The source 
                of trees might be a tree block in the data file. In this case, 
                as you used the blue arrows at the upper portion of the tool palette, 
                you would be browsing through the stored trees, scrolling from 
                one stored tree to another. Alternatively, the source of trees 
                might be a coalescent simulation, in which case you would be browsing 
                through gene trees representing replicate simulations of the coalescent 
                process. Other tree sources may be available, and can be selected 
                when you request the Tree Window for the first time or by using 
                the submenu <font size="-1"><u>Tree&gt;Tree Source&gt;</u></font>. 
                One tree source, &quot;Default Trees&quot;, offers a simple pectinate 
                tree (&quot;Default Ladder&quot;), a full polytomy (&quot;Default 
                Bush&quot;), and a symmetrical tree. It is available merely as 
                a last resort, in case other tree sources are unavailable. 
              <p>We expect a common confusion will be that users will be unable 
                to find the trees that they recently stored in the file. For example, 
                when a new file is created, there are no stored trees, and hence 
                the Tree Window would be forced to use another tree source (for 
                example, &quot;Default Trees&quot;). If a user then stores a tree 
                in the file (see next section), he or she might hit the blue scroll 
                arrows of the Tree Window expecting to browse the stored trees, 
                only to be shown one of the Default Trees. The problem is that 
                the Tree Window is using Default Trees as the tree source, not 
                Stored Trees. To see the trees stored in the file, select <u><font size="-1">Tree&gt;Tree 
                Source&gt;Stored Trees</font></u> to change the tree source to 
                Stored Trees. 
              <h4> <a name="moving"></a>Moving from Tree to Tree</h4>
              <p>To select which tree to view, use the tree scroll at the upper 
                left of the Tree Window: 
              <p align="center"><img src="images/treeScroll.jpg" width="163" height="93" align="middle"> 
              <p>The left and right blue arrows take you to the previous and next 
                trees, respectively, in the tree source. The Go To button takes 
                you to the tree whose number is entered in the text area. The 
                Recent Editings button offers you a drop down menu by which you 
                can return to recently edited trees. The menu lists only trees 
                that you have edited; it does not list the trees that came directly 
                from the tree source, and is therefore not a complete history 
                of recent trees. The number of little white triangles in the button 
                indicates the number of recently edited trees stored. 
              <h4><a name="storing"></a>Storing trees</h4>
              <p>Although the Tree Window can be used merely to browse existing 
                trees, it will commonly be used as a tree editor, allowing the 
                user to build a tree according to some prior hypothesis, or to 
                modify trees to explore the effect of changes in the tree. 
              <p>Once a tree has been edited, the user may want to store this 
                new tree in the file. Exactly how that is done depends on the 
                tree source being used by the Tree Window: 
              <ul>
                <li>If the tree source is Stored Trees, then two menu items are 
                  available in the Tree menu to store trees, &quot;Store Tree&quot; 
                  and &quot;Store Tree As...&quot;. For instance, imagine that 
                  you scroll through the stored trees until you get to tree number 
                  5. If you edit it using the tools of the tool palette, then 
                  you select Store Tree, your newly modified tree will replace 
                  the original tree number 5 in the tree block. If instead you 
                  choose Store Tree As, you will add your modified tree as a new 
                  tree at the end of the tree block, leaving the original tree 
                  number 5 untouched. Thus, Mesquite assumes that you are potentially 
                  editing the original tree in the tree block whenever you edit 
                  the tree. However, the original copy is not replaced by your 
                  edited version until you select &quot;Store Tree&quot;. Until 
                  you select this, your modified tree is maintained as a temporary 
                  tree associated with the tree window, and not stored in the 
                  tree block. 
                <li>If the tree source is not Stored Trees then you can't modify 
                  the original trees, because they are merely temporary trees, 
                  produced by something like a simulation. Thus, in this case 
                  there is no Store Tree menu item available. Instead, there is 
                  a &quot;Store Copy of Tree As&quot; menu item. This acts more 
                  or less like Store Tree As, in that the tree is added to a tree 
                  block. 
              </ul>
              <p>You can tell that a tree has been edited to be different from 
                that in the tree source when a black diamond appears in the message 
                area at the lower left side of the Tree Window. The message area 
                turns green when the tree is an unsaved, edited tree and the tree 
                source is not Stored Trees. 
              <h4> <a name="tools"></a>Tools</h4>
              <p>At the left side of the Tree Window is a <strong>tool palette</strong>, 
                containing tools that you can use to interact with the tree. Exactly 
                which tools are available will depend on the modules installed 
                and loaded. In the description of tools below, it will be assumed 
                that a basic set of modules is installed and loaded. 
              <p>Some tools act when they are touched on a branch of the tree; 
                others act when a branch is touched then dragged and dropped. 
                Some tools behave differently if a key such as shift or control 
                is held down when the tool is used. These details are explained 
                below. Some explanation of the tool is also given in the window's 
                Explanation Area when the tool is selected in the palette. The 
                currently selected tool has its button darker than the rest in 
                the tool palette.
<p>Some tools have options that can be set. If so, then the button 
                for the tool in the tool palette will have a small black triangle 
                indicating the availability of a drop down menu. If you touch 
                the button and hold down the mouse for a moment, the menu will 
                appear to allow you to make choices. 
              <p>The following tools <strong>change the topology</strong> of the 
                tree (the fundamental relationships among taxa implied by the 
                tree). Some of these tools might not be available if their controlling 
                modules are not installed or loaded. <font face="Trebuchet MS">

              <h4> <a name="alterT"></a>Alter/Transform menu items</h4>
              <p>In the Tree menu of the Tree Window are two submenus by which 
                you can change the tree, &quot;Alter/Transform Tree&quot; and 
                &quot;Alter/Transform Branch Lengths&quot;. These provide various 
                utilities to change the tree, including its branch lengths. Some, 
                such as "Scale All Branch Lengths", affect all branches of the 
                tree simultaneously. See the section on <a href="#modifying">automatic 
                modification</a> for more details. 
              <h4> <a name="analyses"></a>Analyses</h4>
              <p>The Tree Window has, in its <strong>Analysis</strong> menu, menu 
                items that yield analyses using the current tree in the Tree Window. 
                Which analyses are available depends on what modules are installed 
                and loaded. Typically the following will be available at least: 
              <ul>
                <li>Trace Character History - Illustrates a history of character 
                  evolution on the tree. Described in detail in the chapter on 
                  <a href="CharacterEvolution/AncestralStates.html">reconstructing 
                  ancestral states</a>.</li>
                <li>Tree Legend - adds a small legend to the Tree Window. The 
                  legend can describe information about the tree, including the 
                  results of calculations done using the tree. When the legend 
                  is in the Tree Window, an additional menu appears, the Legend 
                  menu, by which you can choose to show or hide lines of information. 
                </li>
                <li>Values at Nodes - shows values associated with nodes, either 
                  by coloring the nodes or labeling them. These values describe 
                  information about the nodes, such as a statistic calculated 
                  over the clade above the node. At the moment there are few such 
                  values available (notably, the reconstructed character state 
                  in a continuous character, also available through Trace Character 
                  History).</li>
              </ul></p>
              <h3> <a name="drawing"></a>How trees are drawn</h3>
              <p>There are many options for the appearance of trees as drawn in 
                the Tree Window and other windows displaying trees. Trees may 
                have diagonal, square or circular branches; they may be drawn 
                black on white or green on blue; they may be drawn so that apparent 
                branch length is proportional to assigned branch length. These 
                options are controlled by the Drawing menu. 
              <p>Some of the menu items in the Drawing menu are: 
              <ul>
                <li>Tree Form - Chooses general form of the tree. Some are merely 
                  graphical, others involve analyses such as PlotTree and PlotTree3D 
                  (which plot the tree in a 2D or 3D space) and Contained Gene (or Other) Trees 
                  (which shows gene trees within species trees, or parasites within 
                  hosts).</li>
                <li>Set Current Form As Default - Sets as default the tree drawing 
                  style currently in use (e.g. Diagonal Tree, Balls &amp; Sticks 
                  etc.). It does not capture all of the current parameters chosen 
                  for that drawing form (background color, spot sizes, etc.).</li>
                <li>Background Color - Sets the color of the field on which the 
                  tree is shown.</li>
                <li>Branch Color - Sets the color of the branches. These color 
                  are not retained with the tree, but are for graphical purposes 
                  only. In this regard it is different from the Color Branch tool, 
                  whose colors are retained with the tree.</li>
                <li>Size to Window (Only in the basic Tree Window) - Shrinks the 
                  tree to fit into the window. If this is turned off, then the 
                  tree exists in a panel that may be much bigger than the tree 
                  window itself. To see various parts of this panel, you can use 
                  the scroll bars or the Bird's Eye View box that appears at the 
                  lower left corner of the Tree Window.</li>
                <li>Drawing Size (Only in the basic Tree Window) - When Size to 
                  Window is turned off, this item allows you to set the size of 
                  the panel in which the tree is drawn.</li>
                <li>Float Legends (Only in the basic Tree Window) - When Size 
                  to Window is turned off, this item allows you to choose whether 
                  the legends such as the Tree Legend and Trace Character Legend 
                  are anchored to the panel in which the tree is drawn or, anchored 
                  to the window itself.</li>
                <li>Font, Font Size, Font Color - Sets the font characteristics 
                  of the taxon names and node names.</li>
                <li>Names - Determines what names are shown and whether taxon 
                  names are colored by the <a href="taxa.html#groups">taxon group</a>.</li>
                <li>Orientation (Only for some tree forms) - Chooses whether the 
                  root to terminal orientation is up (classic phylogeneticist 
                  or paleontologist), to the right (molecular evolutionist), bottom 
                  (population geneticist or mathematician) or left (?)</li>
                <li>Branches Proportional to Length - Determines if the drawn 
                  lengths of branches are proportional to their assigned lengths. 
                  Otherwise, the tree drawing routine chooses node positions at 
                  its own convenience. </li>
                <li>Save Macro for Tree Drawing - Saves the current tree drawing 
                  specifications (form, color, orientation, etc.) as a macro. 
                  The macro will then appear under the Macros For Tree Drawing 
                  submenu, and can be used later to set other tree windows to 
                  use the same specifications.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3> <a name="printing"></a>Printing trees and saving graphics files</h3>
              Mesquite's Tree Window offers two menu items for printing trees: 
              Print Tree and Print Tree to Fit Page. The former prints the tree 
              in its current size, even if that requires it to be placed over 
              multiple pages. The latter automatically reduces or enlarges to 
              tree image to fit a single printed page. It attempts to choose landscape 
              or portrait mode to maximize the size of the fitted image. 
              <p>You can also use Save Tree As PDF in the file menu to save the 
                tree image to a PDF file. This works well except that legends 
                (such as the character trace legend) are not included in the image 
                because of an apparent bug in the library we are using. 
              <p>An alternative way to generate image files is to ask to print the tree image, then use 
                your operating system's Print dialog box to direct the output 
                to a file (e.g., postscript or PDF) instead of a printer. Printing 
                to a PDF file is built into the Print Dialog box of Mac OS X and 
                therefore is easy to do. On Windows, printing to a pdf or postscript 
                file is not so straighforward. To do this, use a postscript printer 
                and print to file. The &quot;.prn&quot; file created might in 
                fact be a &quot;.ps&quot; postscript file on the inside. If you 
                are using Windows but don't have a postscript printer then you 
                can add a virtual printer via the Control Panel. Choose a postscript 
                printer driver (e.g. a Laserjet marked as &quot;PS&quot;). Postscript 
                and pdf files are editable by programs such as Adobe Illustrator. 
              <h3> <a name="dependent"></a>Dependent Tree Window</h3>
              This window shows the same tree as in the Tree Window (hence it 
              is "dependent"). It is available in the <strong>Tree</strong> menu 
              of the Tree Window. It is useful when analyses or graphics are desired 
              for the Tree Window, but which would conflict visually with currently 
              running analyses or graphics. Thus, the Dependent Tree Window gives 
              additional space on which to display graphics and analyses. As the 
              tree in the Tree Window is changed, the tree in the Dependent Tree 
              Window is also changed. Note: If the Tree Window is closed, the 
              Dependent Tree Window will close also. 
              <p>Users may find the menus of the Tree Window and Dependent Tree 
                Window somewhat confusing when the latter is in use, as both windows 
                include some menus of the other. This is a consequence of Mesquite's 
                automatic menu arrangement; we realize it is not optimal in this 
                case.</p>
              <h3> <a name="mirror"></a>Mirror Tree Window</h3>
              This window, like the Dependent Tree Window, shows the same tree 
              as in the Tree Window. However, the Mirror Tree Window shows it 
              twice, in mirror image. This allows you to compare, for instance, 
              two different traced characters visually, as in <a href="CharacterEvolution/ProcessCharEvol.html#mirror">this 
              example</a>. The analysis shown on the left side is controlled by 
              the Left side submenu; that on the right by the Right side submenu. 
              <p>Users may find menus confusing when this window is in use; see 
                comments under Dependent Tree Window.</p>
              <h3> <a name="multi"></a>Multi Tree Window</h3>
              This window, available in the <strong>Taxa &amp; Trees</strong> 
              menu, shows multiple trees simultaneously. It is not dependent on 
              a Tree Window, but gets its trees from an available tree source.
