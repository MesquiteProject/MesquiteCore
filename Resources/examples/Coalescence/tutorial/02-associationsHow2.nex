	TEXT  FILE TEXT = 'This file was created as follows.  First, I chose "New" from the File menu.  I indicated the file name in the file dialog box.  Then, when the dialog box came up asking me about a set of taxa, I entered the name ("Species"), and how many taxa (3).  In the taxa list window (e.g., at left), I renamed the taxa (species A, B, C). Next, I made the second set of taxa (e.g., "Genes") by selecting the "New block of taxa" menu item in the Taxa&Trees menu.^n^nNext, I began to indicate how the one set of taxa fits into the other set of taxa.  To do this, I created an "Association" block in the data file (there isn''t a fancy editor for this yet, just a crude one).  I did this by selecting "New Association" in the Taxa&Trees menu.  I was asked to identify the two sets of taxa to be associated, and presented with a simple text editor in a dialog box. ^n^nI then finished writing the "ASSOCIATES" command.  To see an example, go to the Association block window and select "Show example ASSOCIATION block" from the Taxa&Trees menu.  For instance, with these data a possible ASSOCIATES command would be:^n^nASSOCIATES ^n	speciesA /  geneA1 geneA2 , ^n	speciesB /  geneB, ^n	speciesC /  geneC1 geneC2 , ^n;^n^nI entered this.  Then, I closed the Association block window.  This caused the block to be processed.  ^n^nIf you want to see the Association block editor, choose Edit Association from the  Taxa&Trees menu.^n^nTo see the next step in analyzing gene trees within species trees, hit the button in the "Go To File" window.';
