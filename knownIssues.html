		<h2>Known issues for Mesquite (as of version 4 beta)</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Linux: Frequent StackOverflowErrors in graphics calls for Oracle Java (JDK 21, etc, but probably as early as JDK 9). Will cause at least delays, and often freezing of Mesquite. We suspect a bug in the Java itself. Details: Have attempted workarounds, but no success. It is a cycle of validate/validateTree/setFont. </li>
